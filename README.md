# Loan Default Risk Prediction

Predicting whether someone will default on a loan is crucial for managing risk, determining interest rates, and optimizing capital allocation for lenders. It helps financial institutions comply with regulatory requirements, maintain economic stability, and preserve customer relationships by addressing potential defaults early. Accurate predictions also support investor confidence, particularly in markets involving securitized loans, ultimately safeguarding both the financial system and the broader economy.

This project focuses on analyzing a dataset of 5,000 borrowers' loan information to see whether or not they are going to default on the loan.

This project starts with a comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the data's structure and key characteristics. After the EDA component, we will compare several machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree, and XGBoost. Each model's performance will be evaluated using various statistical metrics such as F-Score, Recall, Precision, Accuracy, T-Tests, Coefficients, and adjusted R-squared to determine the most effective model. 

Results: Two models achieved 100% accuracy
