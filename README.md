This project focuses on analyzing a dataset of 5,000 borrowers' loan information, starting with a comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the data's structure and key characteristics. After EDA, we will apply and compare several machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree, and XGBoost. Each model's performance will be evaluated using various statistical metrics such as F-Score, Recall, Precision, Accuracy, T-Tests, Coefficients, and adjusted R-squared to determine the most effective model.
