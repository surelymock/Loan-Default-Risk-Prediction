# Loan Default Risk Prediction

This project focuses on analyzing a dataset of 5,000 borrowers' loan information to see whether or not they are going to default on the loan.

This project starts with a comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the data's structure and key characteristics. After the EDA component, we will compare several machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree, and XGBoost. Each model's performance will be evaluated using various statistical metrics such as F-Score, Recall, Precision, Accuracy, T-Tests, Coefficients, and adjusted R-squared to determine the most effective model. 

For security reasons, I cannot provide the data.
